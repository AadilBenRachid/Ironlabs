Hi, my name is Aadil !
I' m starting a new career in data.
I come from a completly different field, i was a delivery man and then a cab driver in Paris.
What's funny, is that i never touch a computer during that period so all my new skills are only a 9 months ago.
Hope i will survive to this bootcamp.
Hahahah...
